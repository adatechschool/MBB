Here’s a high‑level code‑review and architectural analysis of your micro‑blogging suite:

---

## 1. Overall Architecture & Modularity

- **Microservice separation**  
  You’ve broken the system into three Django services—Authentication, Accounts, and Sessions—each with its own settings, URL config, and Docker container. This gives you strong independence in deployment and scaling.  
- **Shared “common” modules**  
  Common DTOs, event‑publishing, and settings live in a shared folder. This avoids duplication but can introduce tight coupling if changes ripple through multiple repos.  

**Suggestions**  
1. Consider extracting “common” into its own PyPI package (or git submodule) so you can version‑lock changes.  
2. Add an API Gateway or shared reverse proxy (e.g. Traefik) to centralize routing, CORS and authentication, rather than exposing each service’s port directly.

## 2. Domain & Data Modeling

### Django models vs SQL schema

- In `micro_blogging.py` you use `BinaryField` for `profile_picture` and `media_content`. In your SQL dump, `media_type` and `role_name` include database‐level `CHECK` constraints (`IN ('image','video')`, `IN ('user','admin','moderator')`), but your Django models don’t declare those choices.  
- `AccountModel` in the Accounts service reuses the `"User"` table, but you never set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` in settings—so Django’s built‑in auth isn’t actually pointing at your `User` table. Meanwhile the Authentication service calls `get_user_model()`, which by default is the standard Django user, not your microblog `User`.  

**Suggestions**  
- **Unify your user model**: subclass `AbstractBaseUser` and set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` once, so all services refer to the same definition.  
- **Add `choices=` on role_name/media_type** in the Django model to keep model and database in sync and get form validation for free.  
- Consider using Django’s `ImageField` (backed by S3 or a CDN) instead of raw `BinaryField`, especially for large files.

## 3. Repository/Use‑Case Layer

- You’ve adopted a clean “ports & adapters” style:  
  - **UseCases** sit in `service/application/use_cases.py`  
  - **Repository interfaces** define contracts in `…repositories.py`  
  - **Django ORM repositories** implement those contracts  
- DTOs (via Pydantic) decouple your internal models from external APIs.

**Strengths**  
- Clear separation of concerns and easy to swap out persistence layers.  
- Pydantic DTOs give you validation and serialization.

**Opportunities**  
1. In your `DjangoAccountRepository.get_account()` you catch `DoesNotExist` and re‑raise `AccountNotFound`, but in `delete_account()` you catch and swallow exceptions—consider unifying: always raise `AccountNotFound` if no rows were affected.  
2. For high‑throughput, you might batch‐publish Kafka events asynchronously (e.g. via Celery) instead of calling `producer.flush()` synchronously on each request.

## 4. Error Handling & HTTP Semantics

- Controllers map domain exceptions to HTTP codes—404 for not‑found, 409 for conflicts, etc.  
- You consistently wrap responses in `{status, data, error}` envelopes.

**Edge Cases**  
- In your token‐refresh view, any unexpected exception becomes a 401. It may be more appropriate to return 500 on truly unexpected errors, so clients can distinguish bad tokens from server faults.  
- In session refresh, you accept the old token when the new one isn’t provided, but you don’t explicitly blacklist the old one unless `new_refresh` is present. Make sure that aligns with your security requirements.

---

## 5. DevOps & Tooling

- **Docker compose** uses env‑vars for ports and credentials—nice 12‑factor style.  
- **Pre‑commit** excludes `micro_blogging.py` to work around Black’s missing encoding declaration.  
- **Flake8** excludes migrations and your single file; you ignore E501/E265 to allow long lines and comment styles.

**Recommendations**  
1. Rather than excluding `micro_blogging.py` from Black, add `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` at the top so Black can parse it—or explicitly add `# fmt: off` if you truly never want it formatted.  
2. Add a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) that runs your pre‑commit checks—and also runs `pytest` on each service (with an SQLite in‑memory DB) to catch regressions early.  
3. Keep your `.env` out of version control; consider a secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for production.

## 6. Security & Best Practices

- You’re using JWTs with short lifetimes and rotating/blacklisting refresh tokens—good.  
- You haven’t enabled HTTPS settings (e.g. `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`) in production mode.  

**To harden**  
- In production, enforce HTTPS, set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`.  
- Use `django‑axes` or a similar rate‑limiting app on login endpoints to guard against brute‑force.  
- Ensure `DEBUG=False` in production and configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` accordingly.

### Conclusion

You’ve built a clean, well‑layered microservices Django system with clear separation of domain logic and API controllers, good use of DTOs, and solid CI tooling. Addressing the few discrepancies between your ORM models and the raw SQL schema, unifying your user model, refining error handling, and tightening security will take you the rest of the way to a production‑grade platform. Let me know if you’d like deeper guidance on any of these points!
